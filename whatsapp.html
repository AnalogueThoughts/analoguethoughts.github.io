<h1>Whatsapp, you cheeky bastard</h1>

<p> First and foremost, I should say this is a quick jotted down response to the Whatsapp privacy policy change that, while brewing in my head for some time already,
 I wrote in a couple of days while fighting with some very basic html and web design. I just put together some thoughts, resulting from some intermittent 
 reading throughout the years and the fear of anonymous entities spying on my  (of course, always very reputable) online activity. 
 Naturally, this is my opinion and you are very welcome to disagree. In fact, please do! Like everyone, I am still reading and learning and I would love to hear 
 your thoughts, whether you agree or dissent, and what I may have missed - privacy is often not in our minds, but I think it should be! </p>
