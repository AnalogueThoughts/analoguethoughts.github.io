<h1>Whatsapp, you cheeky bastard</h1>

<a href="https://analoguethoughts.com/whatsappesp.html/"> Version en español aquí!</a> 
 
<p> First and foremost, I should say this is a quick jotted down response to the Whatsapp privacy policy change that, while brewing in my head for some time already,
 I wrote in a couple of days while fighting with some very basic html and web design. I just put together some thoughts, resulting from some intermittent 
 reading throughout the years and the fear of anonymous entities spying on my  (of course, always very reputable) online activity. 
 Naturally, this is my opinion and you are very welcome to disagree. In fact, please do! Like everyone, I am still reading and learning and I would love to hear 
 your thoughts, whether you agree or dissent, and what I may have missed - privacy is often not in our minds, and even less often discussed,  but I think it should 
 be! Hope that this post helps some of you, curious ones, and opens some discussion!</p>
 
 <ul>
  <li>Why should communications be encrypted?</li>
  <li>What is encryption?</li>

 <h4>Whatsapp vs Signal</h4>
 
 
 <h4>Telegram</h4>
 In response to Whatsapp's privacy policy update, lots of users have recently migrated to Telegram, seen by many as the secure alternative to Whatsapp. While Telegram 
 might boast some nice features, this is something that I can only understand as the result of a wonderful marketing team. These are some of the reasons I struggle to
 understand the switch to Telegram (even from Whatsapp!!).
 
 <ul>
  <li>Telegram chats are not encrypted per default, which in practice means most conversations will not be encrypted (note, Whatsapp does encrypt all conversations).
  One could say, well, but you can always use the alternative encrypted mode. And indeed, you could, but that creates an unnecessary differentiation between users.
  "If you have nothing to hide, why would you choose to hide your communications", it singles out the users who choose to activaye it. See, for example, the case 
  of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nsa-likely-targets-anybody-whos-tor-curious/"> using Tor</a>, a browser that anonymizes your traffic. Privacy, encryption 
  in this case, should be by default! </li>
  <li>Unencrypted Telegram messages are stored on Telegram's servers.</li>
  <li>Telegram group chats are not encrypted</li>
 </ul>
